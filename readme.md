# Strife RTX PBR Re-Texture Assets

These are the textures I'm using in my Strife (1996) remaster in Unreal Engine with RTX. You can just use these for whatever you want. They are hand crafted and oak barrel aged. There might be issues with the names of the textures, meaning that in the process of exporting from DOOM BUILDER the names might of gotten "confused" and might not align correctly with their original names. I will eventually go through and manually check each texture in each map and make sure everything lines up name wise.
